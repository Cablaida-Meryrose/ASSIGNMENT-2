                    <p>I am Mery Rose Villapando Cablaida. A student from Bachelors of Science in Information Technology. I know that the course isn't a piece of nut for me, but since I chose this course voluntarily,I believe, that I will overcome all the challenges that will come on my way till I say "I made it". </p>

                    <h1>MY HOBBY</h1>
                    <p>The photo above was taken during one of our practice in Rondalla when I was on the 8th Grade. Back then, I was clueless on how a 14 stringed instrument is working until I joined the group and became really fascinated with it. Infact, Ive chose to stay in that specific group of musicians until I finished highschool. </p>

                    <h1>THAT GUY</h1>
                    <p>TJ Monterde, I just love the way he is. For me, in the world of men,he's a huge green flag.I love his songs, from the lyrics to its melody and harmony, plus the delivery, everything's interesting. Infact, his music always brought me somewhere and leave me daydreaming bout things in life whenevr i listen to it . </p>
